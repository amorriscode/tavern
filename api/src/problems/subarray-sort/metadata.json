  "description": "Write a function that takes  in an array of at least 2 integers and that returns an array of the starting and ending indices of th esmallest subarray in the input array that needs to be sorted in place in order for the entire input array to be sorted (in ascending order. If the input array is already sorted the function should return [-1, -1]",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "hints": [
    "There are parts of this you can do in a single pass.",
    "Even a single out of order number in the input array can call for a large subarray to have to be sorted. This is because, depending on how out of place the number is, it might need to be moved very far away from its original position in order to be in its sorted position",
    "Find the smallest and largest number that are out of order in the input array. You should be able to do this in a single pass through the array. "
